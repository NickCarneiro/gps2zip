# HTML5 Express EJS Boilerplate ("H5EEB")

Get started with a modern boilerplate for [Express](http://expressjs.com)!

Everyone has their own boilerplate. Why use this one?

* No jade or stylus. Use what you know, straight html and css
* No databases pre-installed. Choose what you want.
* Recent jQuery (1.7.1)

## Requirements
  * [node](https://github.com/joyent/node)
  * [npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm)

# Quick Start

      Coming soon.
